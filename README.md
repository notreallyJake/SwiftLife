SwiftLife
=========

A game of life simulator written in Swift
Partially inspired by: https://github.com/yonbergman/swift-gameoflife

I based this on code I once wrote when I was learning SpriteKit.
It's not fancy or special, but it works quite well. It's a nice exercise in adapting existing code to Swift.

I challenge you to make it better!
